Ta-180 is the rarest isotope of Nature's rarest element. It exists only in an a long-lived (10^15y half life) isomer (Jpi=9-; E=75 keV). Potential s-process production path is easy to point out, but the survival of this fragile piece of nature at finite temperature is unlikely...

The mysteries of strange Nature's sons can be investigated with a combination of the thermodynamic of s-process sites, p-process and neutrino nucleosynthesis.
