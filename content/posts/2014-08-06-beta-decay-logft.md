The comparative half life _ft_ is useful to compare the strength of the

and electron-capture processes over different nuclei. 
<span><img src="/wilt/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_b0603860fcffe94e5b8eec59ed813421.gif"/></span>-decay half lives can span several orders of magnitude, from fraction of seconds to thousands of time the age of the universe. Some of these striking differences are due to relatively trivial energetic conditions, but the more interesting from a nuclear structure point of view are due to the wavefunction superposition and the angular momentum coupling.

The comparative half life _ft_ is useful to purge from energetic and kinematic details the reaction and analyze just the nuclear structure behind. For example _superallowed_ decays, that go from a

<span><img src="/wilt/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_01833ac32e15b5454eee043664e1a939.gif"/></span> 
ground state, should have very similar structure overall conditions, thus similar _ft_, even if the half life vary by orders of magnitude. And in fact the value of

for all the known superallowed decays even if the half life span from few seconds to few milliseconds.

The comparative half life is given by

where the Matrix element

for superallowed, 
<span><img src="/wilt/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_303dc74df5fdb166a7f98d48168bece0.gif"/></span> 
for allowed, and lesser for forbidden type of decays (superallowed, allowed and forbidden type of decays are dependent on the eventual unit of angular momentum and parity the radiation has to carry away, cf. Wikipedia for a list), and

thus, considering _ft_ in the unit of seconds we have

with _C_ the square matrix element in natural unit.

Making use of the _ft_ value expressed in second we can deduce a common value in the Beta-decay jargon that is the logft, that is now trivially

Common example of values of logft are, ~ 3.5 for superallowed decays (as specified above), ~5.5 for allowed, ~8 for first forbidden and ~11 for second forbidden.
