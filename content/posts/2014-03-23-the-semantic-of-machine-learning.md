Today I learned again that most things in life are a matter of semantics... After some online lectures in Machine Learning techniques I discovered that what I call _"Ordinary Least Squares"_ is generalized as a "_cost function_" and a simplified version of the _"Newton Method"_ is refferred to as _"Gradient Descent"._

So, basically, the core of a supervisedÂ learned algorithm seems to be the choose of an appropriate _"cost function"_ and the application of the most effective minimization algorithm.
