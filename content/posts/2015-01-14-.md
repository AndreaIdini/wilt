Detailed calculation of two-body matrix elements for a Cooper pair (coupled to J=0, T=0, but also S=0), following the structure of the previous two posts ([[1]][1], [[2]][2]), for the case of a Gaussian interaction between the members of the Cooper pair coupled to S=0 in the LS coupling scheme (the generalization to S=1 case is a good exercise).

Also the (Local) extension to higher order is included.
