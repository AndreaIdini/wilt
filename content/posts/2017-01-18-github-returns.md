I am setting up and using the public github repository after many years. I decided to start releasingÂ some old projects publicly, since seems apparent I will never have time to write anymore papers, nor to polish the code.

Eventually, at least for these little _"didactic"_ subprojects, I will start to do little explanatory videos, or blogposts, instead of articles just to save times and make the process more fluid.

So, with the philosophy of releasing as process, not as product, here it is the first project on Pairing Vibration RPA:

Enjoy and let me know.
