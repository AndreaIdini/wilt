Today I learned that the a V-2 rocket was much faster than the speed of sound, in fact the max speed was more around Mach-4 (5,760Â km/h to be more precise, according to wikipedia), and flied using a water-ethanol compund and <span style="text-decoration: underline">liquid oxygen (!)</span>.

Some survivors were in fact reporting the hitting of the blast in utter silence followed by the sonic boom and the sound of hell breaking loose.

Here's a goody: the mapping of all the V-2 landings in London: [http://londonist.com/2009/01/london\_v2\_rocket_sitesmapped.php][1]
