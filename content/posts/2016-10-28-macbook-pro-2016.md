Macbook Pro 2016 update sports still LPDDR3 RAM memory, in 8GB or 16GB size, and 1866 or 2133 MHz CL11 or CL12.

Frankly I'm furious that a 2300Â£ (starting from) laptop still uses a 9 years old standard, while a newer one is available since more than a year.

Already the Skylake processor is a setback, but the DDR3 memory on a Intel graphics laptop is practically a scam.

Dell XPS15 offers better specs since June, in roughly the same size.

Good riddance on the Mac sector, Apple, continue to produce expensive toys...
