Matter-Antimatter symmetry violation might have found it's first culprit and have been recently published on Nature (here's the arXivÂ https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05216 )

Together with the results of AMS (pasted) have been an interesting 2016 for big collaborations.

What can nuclear physics contribute to such big and fancy experiments and new quests for dark matter or CP symmetry? All these experiments use nuclei at one point or another of their experimental chain, all of them use the strong force and its low-energy extrapolation...
