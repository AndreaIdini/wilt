A IMHO good picture to didactically illustrate the effect of many-body dynamics on nuclei.

I post it here since that it did not make it to the final version of the Proceeding for Pisa conference, but I think it illustrate nicely how, from the combination of several base stateÂ wavefunctions we build many-body wavefunctions which have different properties (are quenched, so posses spectroscopic factors, and have a completely different tail) from the harmonic oscillator starting pointÂ (dashed).

This is also why reaction dynamics are way different calculated with a complete set of many-body relation instead of a simple mean field picture.

IMHO would also be difficult to reproduce the richness of these <span><img src="/wilt/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_67889bfbd8a5fd1aa52ac67518b5df91.gif' style=' ' class='tex'" /></span> wavefunctions with a single Wood Saxon, let alone an harmonic oscillator potential (you can notice that the decay of the <span><img src="/wilt/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_a51da73e439b13a7bec9e85e19646d78.gif"/></span> is quite fat respect to the exponential of an harmonic oscillator eigenfunction).

Non-local optical potentials are the way to go! ðŸ˜‰

(absolutely objective and no conflict of interest there), more info here:Â [arXiv:1612.01478][1] [nucl-th], and soon-to-be publication.

Enjoy.
