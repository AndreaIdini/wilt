An admissible structure is one satisfying the following three properties.
 The set S* is everywhere dense in S The VC-dimension of each set of functions contained in S is finite. Any element of the structure contains totally bounded functions  </description>

      <description>In the first part of the file tutorial2.py of repository Tensorflow in my github, you have the commented version of the MINST tutorial for experts in Tensorflow.
Tensorflow is an opensource API for several languages that act as frontend for a machine learning backend that is quite flexible.
What I was surprised for is the result of this first small exercise, that is: you take the pixel of the MINST package for character recognition traning.</description>

      <description>In a two days coding challenge over workers day holiday, I decided to play with maps as means to plot information. What I decided to are use are the widely available shapefiles and python matplotlib packages, using mainly pandas and numpy to analyse data.
You can find everything in this git repository.
First of all you can start familiarising with shapefiles by plotting the pure patches, as in function mP in mapPlot.</description>

      <description>I read a lot of misconceptions this morning related to this article regarding Google Translate. Is not properly fresh news but this morning in my telegram group @scienza, this other popularization article has been posted that completely misunderstood the premises of the original academic article (also the so-called informed comments are not really , so I decided to try to keep the record straight and offer a question.
In the article the approach is referred as a multitasking learning framework</description>

      <description>Matter-Antimatter symmetry violation might have found it&amp;rsquo;s first culprit and have been recently published on Nature (here&amp;rsquo;s the arXiv https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05216 )
Together with the results of AMS (pasted) have been an interesting 2016 for big collaborations.
What can nuclear physics contribute to such big and fancy experiments and new quests for dark matter or CP symmetry? All these experiments use nuclei at one point or another of their experimental chain, all of them use the strong force and its low-energy extrapolation&amp;hellip;</description>

The first eigenvalue at -23.97 MeV (solid red line) is compared by the corresponding  harmonic oscillator state multiplied by the square root of the spectroscopic factor (dashed red line), the second eigenvalue at -2.85 MeV (solid blue line) is similarly compared with  harmonic oscillator state (dashed blue line).</description>

      <description>I am setting up and using the public github repository after many years. I decided to start releasing some old projects publicly, since seems apparent I will never have time to write anymore papers, nor to polish the code.
Eventually, at least for these little &amp;ldquo;didactic&amp;rdquo; subprojects, I will start to do little explanatory videos, or blogposts, instead of articles just to save times and make the process more fluid.</description>

      <title>Fun with conditional probability</title>
      <link>http://wilt.phme.it/2015/05/26/fun-with-conditional-probability/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bayesian concept of probability is linked not with frequency, but with state of information. The processing of this information proceeds in a propositional sense. In fact there are semantic work related to the use of Bayesian statistic as foundation for programming languages (&lt;a href=&#34;http://bayesianlogic.github.io/&#34;&gt;BLOG&lt;/a&gt;), First kind logic (&lt;a href=&#34;http://seor.gmu.edu/~klaskey/papers/Laskey_MEBN_Logic.pdf&#34;&gt;MEBN&lt;/a&gt; , also look at the fun &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1207/1207.1354.pdf&#34;&gt;Of Starships and Klingon&lt;/a&gt;) and thus the foundation principles of Network-Centric warfare and commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property of Baysian calculation of proabability are sometimes difficult to grasp and very counter intuitive, interesting consideration can hide behind apparently trivial formulas that can help to answer questions like: &lt;em&gt;If you know your neighbour has a son born on Tuesday, which is the probability your neighbour has two sons?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Value at Risk on expected return</title>
      <link>http://wilt.phme.it/2015/05/10/value-on-expected-return/</link>

      <guid>http://wilt.phme.it/2015/05/10/value-on-expected-return/</guid>
      <description>Value at Risk on expected return is the lower bound for the loss in an investement respect to a probability.
Is a way to estimating losses probabilities in terms of value, instead of standard deviation. E.g. in the case of , means that the investor have a probability  of loosing € or more, investing € on the portfolio .
Considering the system ergodic and thus all the variances of the titles summing up coherently to for a variance of the portfolio distributed within the normal distribution, this is simply calculated considering the quantile (the value of the distribution corresponding to a certain fraction  of probability) .</description>

      <title>No-Arbitrage condition</title>

      <description>No Arbitrage states the inadmissibility of Free Lunch in applying a structure (metric?) to the prices.
Considering a title with price  and cash flow , or every time , where  it is the discretized time .
Then we have the two No-Arbitrage condition:
 Weak No-Arbitrage : if  Strong No-Arbitrage: if  and   Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose a world where I can borrow money with fixed interest rate , which will be the price  of a product with interest  over one year?</description>

      <title>Optimizing: the Minimum Variance (or Maximum Return) Portfolio example</title>
      <link>http://wilt.phme.it/2015/05/05/optimizing-the-portfolio/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2015 21:16:59 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wilt.phme.it/2015/05/05/optimizing-the-portfolio/</guid>
      <description>The aim is the optimization either by maximizing total return (or minimizing risk), in keeping with the constraints of normalization for a given risk (or return).
Thus Lagrange method is perfectly suited for the job.
For minimizing risk, respect to a desired total return , one must consider the function of total risk
 and minimize the lagrangian with constrain over the desired return and sum to one of weights.</description>

      <title>Theorical ArXiv of Cook and Rossi</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are several aspects of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01261&#34;&gt;paper of Norman Cook and Andrea Rossi&lt;/a&gt; that scream &amp;ldquo;amateurish&amp;rdquo;: from layout to typos (hoping they&amp;rsquo;re so), from historical concepts to bibliography, I&amp;rsquo;m not certainly the only one to have noted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is the scientific thesis to be flawed, even without considering the disputed history of E-cat and LENR and possible prejudices one can have on the author and its reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The comparative half life ft is useful to compare the strength of the  and electron-capture processes over different nuclei. -decay half lives can span several orders of magnitude, from fraction of seconds to thousands of time the age of the universe. Some of these striking differences are due to relatively trivial energetic conditions, but the more interesting from a nuclear structure point of view are due to the wavefunction superposition and the angular momentum coupling.</description>

      <title>The mistery of Nature&#39;s sons</title>

      <description>Ta-180 is the rarest isotope of Nature&amp;rsquo;s rarest element. It exists only in an a long-lived (10^15y half life) isomer (Jpi=9-; E=75 keV). Potential s-process production path is easy to point out, but the survival of this fragile piece of nature at finite temperature is unlikely&amp;hellip;
The mysteries of strange Nature&amp;rsquo;s sons can be investigated with a combination of the thermodynamic of s-process sites, p-process and neutrino nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <description>The three Borromean rings.  There are some properties of few-body systems that are &amp;ldquo;Universal&amp;rdquo;, so shared between all few-body systems that feel an attractive interaction (with certain boundary properties for defining eventual spin-orbit and isospin).
An example of this behavior are the Efimov states of three-body systems: when an interaction loosely bound two bodies, the three-body system have a precise spectrum of excitation. This spectrum is observed in three nucleons systems like Helium-3 and Triton, since the two-body system, the deuteron, is loosely bound (for nuclear scales).</description>
