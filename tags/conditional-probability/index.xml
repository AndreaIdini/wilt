      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bayesian concept of probability is linked not with frequency, but with state of information. The processing of this information proceeds in a propositional sense. In fact there are semantic work related to the use of Bayesian statistic as foundation for programming languages (&lt;a href=&#34;http://bayesianlogic.github.io/&#34;&gt;BLOG&lt;/a&gt;), First kind logic (&lt;a href=&#34;http://seor.gmu.edu/~klaskey/papers/Laskey_MEBN_Logic.pdf&#34;&gt;MEBN&lt;/a&gt; , also look at the fun &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1207/1207.1354.pdf&#34;&gt;Of Starships and Klingon&lt;/a&gt;) and thus the foundation principles of Network-Centric warfare and commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property of Baysian calculation of proabability are sometimes difficult to grasp and very counter intuitive, interesting consideration can hide behind apparently trivial formulas that can help to answer questions like:Â &lt;em&gt;If you know your neighbour has a son born on Tuesday, which is the probability your neighbour has two sons?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
